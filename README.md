## Semantic Search Approach Using BERT and LDA(TF-IDF)
#Project Overview
-This project demonstrates a semantic search approach applied to a dataset of books. It employs two methods:

**BERT-Based Semantic Search**: Uses pre-trained sentence embeddings to understand the contextual meaning of book titles and queries.
**LDA-Based Semantic Search (TF-IDF)**: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to calculate relevance scores.
The project improves information retrieval by using both contextual embeddings and statistical methods for comparison.
